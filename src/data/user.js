	about: {
		title: "I’m Shivam Sharma, a Java Spring Boot Backend Developer.",
		description:
			"I began my journey in software development by pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT), Gorakhpur. During my academic journey, I focused on Java and Spring Boot, building multiple backend projects to gain hands-on experience in designing scalable and secure applications. Along the way, I worked on a variety of personal and academic projects, many of which are open-source, allowing me to explore real-world backend challenges such as API design, database integration, authentication, and performance optimization. These projects played a key role in strengthening my problem-solving skills and understanding of clean architecture and best practices. I enjoy learning by building, experimenting, and continuously improving my code. I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and new ideas, and I’m actively looking for opportunities to grow as a backend developer and work on impactful real-world systems.",
